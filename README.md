# Rapid-Roll
A game made using sfml and C++. \
This is an attempt to make a game similar to Rapid-Roll which was earlier in Nokia-Mobile phones. \
For an idea of what this game look like you can check out this [video](https://youtu.be/ZmhN7h48YDA). \
In this project we tried to replicate what you just saw in the above video link.

## Run on Local Machine
- Clone the repository
- Cd into the project directory.
- Make sure you have *mingw32* or *gnu make* installed for windows.
- Open up a new terminal and type 
> mingw32-make

OR simply make if you have make installed

> make

This will compile and link all the required files to run the game.

<hr>

This game is not complete yet in terms of all the functionalities. \

Note: We are yet to find a method for makefile to run on mac.
